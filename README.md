How to train and test Cifar10 data by using CNN in tensorflow.

## Introduction
* Help to study Tensorflow CNN, and realize a sample about Cifar10 data.

## Requirements
* Python
* NumPy
* [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

## Usage
* Scripts
```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/avBuffer/Cifar10_tensorflow.git
